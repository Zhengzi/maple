# maple
Maple(tmp name) is a binary analysing platform, which is going to be developed by me and ?.

First functionality to be achieved is binary backward slicing.

1. Add extract_info_ida_plugin.py and analysis_basic_block.py

Usage: open ida pro -> load script -> select this file

2. Working on the backward slcing for x86. Stop here, and continue tomorrow

3. Future work: apply the semetic learning for binary instruction groups.
